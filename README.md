**Libft - Custom C Library Implementation | 42 Academy | Score: 125/100 | Completed: May 20, 2024**

üìã **Project Overview**

Libft is the foundational project of 42 Academy's curriculum, requiring students to recreate essential C standard library functions from scratch. This project serves as an introduction to C programming fundamentals and establishes the foundation for all subsequent 42 projects.
Challenge: Build a custom C library without prior C programming experience, implementing memory management, string manipulation, and linked list operations.

This project represents the beginning of my journey in systems programming and established the technical foundation that supports all my subsequent development work at 42 Academy.


üîß **Key Technical Skills Developed**
- Memory Management Mastery: Dynamic allocation and memory leak prevention
- Buffer Handling: Safe memory operations with bounds checking
- Pointer Arithmetic: Deep understanding of pointer manipulation and dereferencing
- C Programming Fundamentals: Writing efficient, readable C functions following strict coding standards
- Error Handling: Robust input validation and edge case management
- Makefile Creation: Automated compilation with proper dependencies and flags
- Problem-Solving Methodology and testing strategy: Comprehensive testing approach including edge cases and error conditions
- Algorithm Design: Implementing efficient solutions for string and memory operations
- Code Optimization: Balancing readability and performance in low-level operations

üöÄ **Learning Outcomes**

This project marked my transition from zero C programming knowledge to understanding:
- Systems Programming: Low-level memory operations and system calls
- Software Engineering Practices: Code organization, documentation, and testing methodologies
- 42 Methodology: Self-directed learning, peer collaboration, and code review processes

üå±**Personal Growth**

- Technical Foundation: Established solid base in C programming that supports all subsequent 42 projects
- Problem Decomposition: Learned to break complex problems into manageable functions
- Quality Standards: Developed attention to detail required for systems-level programming

üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Specifications**

- Language: C
