This is my final libft project, passed with 125/100 on may 20th 2024. 
Feel free to copy any content, but please please please do not just copy,
but learn, investigate, and fully understand every single line of code.
It is essential that you do and run your own tests.

Credit to all the people who helped me with this fantastic project, as I had zero
previous experience with C. Many thanks to my mentor xmatute-, and all my fellow students 
who helped me. vlorenzo, ilastra-, iziat-hi, otboumeh, iportill, jcordon-, dangonz3,
and many many others.

Good learning!
